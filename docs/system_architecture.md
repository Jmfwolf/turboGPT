# System Architecture

The ChatGPT client app is designed with a three-tier architecture that consists of a presentation layer, a business layer, and a data layer. Each layer is responsible for specific tasks and communicates with the other layers through defined interfaces.

## Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user and processing user input. It consists of a Java Swing-based GUI that provides the user with a chat interface and customization options. The presentation layer communicates with the business layer through a REST API to send and receive data.

## Business Layer

The business layer is responsible for processing user input and communicating with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint. It consists of a Java-based client SDK that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint through a REST API. The business layer also communicates with the data layer to store and retrieve chat history and user settings.

## Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for storing and retrieving chat history and user settings. It consists of a SQLite database that is accessed through a Java-based data access layer. The data layer communicates with the business layer to provide chat history and user settings as needed.
Data Flow

The data flow in the ChatGPT client app follows this pattern:

1. User input is received by the presentation layer and passed to the business layer through the REST API.

2. The business layer processes the user input and sends a request to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint through the REST API.

3. The OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint generates a response and sends it back to the business layer through the REST API.

4. The business layer sends the response to the presentation layer through the REST API for display to the user.

5. Chat history and user settings are stored in the SQLite database through the data access layer and retrieved as needed by the business layer.

## Conclusion

The ChatGPT client app is designed with a scalable and flexible architecture that can be modified and adapted as needed. The three-tier architecture provides a clear separation of concerns and enables each layer to focus on its specific tasks. By following this architecture, we can ensure that the app is maintainable, efficient, and easy to use for our users.
