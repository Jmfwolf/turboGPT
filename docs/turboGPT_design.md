## Introduction

turboGPT is a portable Java application designed to provide users with a customizable and private way to access the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint. With turboGPT, users can access ChatGPT without the need for a browser and customize various aspects of the app, such as font size, color scheme, and chat history settings.

The app is designed with a three-tier architecture that separates the presentation layer, business layer, and data layer. The presentation layer consists of a Java Swing-based GUI that provides users with a chat interface and customization options. The business layer includes a Java-based client SDK that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint through a REST API. The data layer includes a SQLite database that stores chat history and user settings.

The data model for turboGPT includes entities such as users, chat sessions, and messages. The app is designed to be scalable and flexible, allowing for easy modification and adaptation as needed. This design document outlines the system architecture, data model, and user stories for turboGPT, and provides a roadmap for the development of the app.

## System Architecture

turboGPT is designed with a three-tier architecture that separates the presentation layer, business layer, and data layer. Each layer is responsible for specific tasks and communicates with the other layers through defined interfaces.

### Presentation Layer

The presentation layer is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user and processing user input. It consists of a Java Swing-based GUI that provides the user with a chat interface and customization options. The presentation layer communicates with the business layer through a REST API to send and receive data.

### Business Layer

The business layer is responsible for processing user input and communicating with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint. It consists of a Java-based client SDK that interacts with the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint through a REST API. The business layer also communicates with the data layer to store and retrieve chat history and user settings.

### Data Layer

The data layer is responsible for storing and retrieving chat history and user settings. It consists of a SQLite database that is accessed through a Java-based data access layer. The data layer communicates with the business layer to provide chat history and user settings as needed.

### Data Flow

The data flow in turboGPT follows this pattern:

    User input is received by the presentation layer and passed to the business layer through the REST API.
    The business layer processes the user input and sends a request to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint through the REST API.
    The OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint generates a response and sends it back to the business layer through the REST API.
    The business layer sends the response to the presentation layer through the REST API for display to the user.
    Chat history and user settings are stored in the SQLite database through the data access layer and retrieved as needed by the business layer.

## Data Models

The data models for turboGPT include entities such as users, chat sessions, and messages. The attributes and relationships of each entity are defined below:

### User Entity

The user entity stores information about the users of the app, including their name, email, and password.

    id: integer
    name: string
    email: string
    password: string

### Chat Session Entity

The chat session entity stores information about the individual chat sessions, including the user who initiated the chat session and when the chat session was created.

    id: integer
    user_id: integer
    created_at: datetime

### Message Entity

The message entity stores information about the individual messages, including the chat session the message is associated with, the user who sent the message, and the content of the message.

    id: integer
    chat_session_id: integer
    user_id: integer
    message: text
    created_at: datetime

### Entity Relationships

The entity relationships in turboGPT are defined as follows:

    A user can have multiple chat sessions.
    A chat session can have multiple messages.
    A message belongs to a single chat session and a single user.

## User Interface Design

The turboGPT user interface is designed to provide users with an intuitive and customizable chat interface. The user interface consists of the following components:

### Chat Window
