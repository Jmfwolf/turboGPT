# turboGPT
This project provides a Java application that allows users to use OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint in a private client. This allows users who are more privacy-sensitive or would like a customized client to do so.

## Design and Development Plan

Please Look at the turboGPT_design in the docs directory

## Updates

The OpenAPI specification needs work before it can be used to generate SDKs heavily typed lanugages such as Java.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

This project is based on the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo endpoint and uses the OpenAPI specification to generate a Java client SDK. I would like to acknowledge the contributions of the OpenAI team, OpenAPI team, and the open-source community.
